# Weasel

Weasel is a secure replacement for the [stock messaging app](https://github.com/android/platform_packages_apps_mms) included with Android, developed by [hackSugar](https://github.com/hackSugar).

## Information

The Weasel application is designed to encrypt SMS messages sent to and from a particular Android device, using RSA-2048 encryption.
