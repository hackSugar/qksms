# Weasel

Weasel is a secure replacement for the [stock messaging app](https://github.com/android/platform_packages_apps_mms) included with Android, based on the QKSMS project by [Moez Bhatti](https://github.com/moezbhatti).

## Information

The Weasel application is designed to encrypt SMS messages sent to and from a particular Android device, using RSA-2048 encryption. 

This system is designed to ensure that the only person receiving an SMS message is the person it was meant for.
